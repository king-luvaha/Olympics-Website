            <h1>Fun facts About Kenya</h1>
            <p>Considering how absolutely incredible Kenya is, I dont think it gets talked about nearly enough! This diverse country in East Africa is home to all five of the Big 5. The landscape dramatically transforms as you move across the country; from the vibrant escarpments of the Great Rift Valley, to the sweeping plains of the Amboseli National Park, and the vast Indian Ocean stretching across the coastline.<br>Here are some Interesting facts about Kenya:</p>
        </section>

        <!----------------Interesting Facts------------->

        <section class="facts">
            <h2 class="block-heading">1. Kenya has 50 national parks and reserves</h2>
            <p>You’ve probably heard of the Masai Mara National Park and Amboseli National Park. They’re both popular safari destinations and Amboseli offers unbeatable views of Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro. But did you know there are a total of 50 national parks and reserves in Kenya? That’s right, 22 national parks and 28 national reserves are managed and maintained by the Kenya Wildlife Service, ensuring that the native wildlife of this land is protected against hunters and poachers.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">2. The Great Rift Valley was formed more than 25 million years ago</h2>
            <p>This is probably one of THE most interesting facts about Kenya. Slicing through Kenya from north to south is the Great Rift Valley, also known as the East African Rift Valley. It was formed more than 25 million years ago by geological tension in the earth’s crust and is approximately 6500 kilometres long and 60 kilometres wide. The wide valley allowed for many lakes to form, creating unique habitats for the country’s wildlife.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">3. There are over 60 languages spoken in Kenya</h2>
            <p>While Kenya may only have two official languages, Kiswahili (also referred to as Swahili) and English, there are around 68 languages spoken throughout the country.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">4. Mount Kenya is the second-highest mountain in Africa</h2>
            <p>Another interesting fact about Kenya is that after Mount Kilimanjaro in neighbouring Tanzania, Mount Kenya is the second highest mountain in Africa.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">5. Kenya is the world’s leading safari destination</h2>
            <p>Kenya has been recognised by the World Travel Awards as the world’s leading safari destination for 2021, a position it has held for seven years now!</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">6. Kenya is home to the world’s best long-distance runners</h2>
            <p>There must be something in the water in Kenya! In particular, the country’s Kalenjin people have produced many world record breaking athletes and long-distance runners, known for dominating marathon circuits worldwide.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">7. The Great Wildebeest Migration has no beginning or end point&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>Many people think the Great Migration happens only once a year, however this natural phenomenon occurs year-round, meaning it technically does not ‘start’ or ‘finish’ anywhere, which makes this one of the most interesting facts about Kenya. The wildebeest, zebra and antelope migrate in a clockwise loop between Kenya and Tanzania, and Kenya’s Masai Mara Nature Reserve is one of the best locations to witness one of earth’s greatest shows.</p>

            <h2 class="block-heading">8. The first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize is from Kenya</h2>
            <p>In 2004, Wangari Muta Maathai won the Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace. She was the founder of the Green Belt Movement, which has planted over 51 million trees in Kenya.</p>

            <h2>9. Kenya has 536 kilometres of coastline on the Indian Ocean</h2>
            <p>When thinking about your next relaxing beach holiday, Kenya probably doesn’t come to mind but, like Zanzibar, it has miles of white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. Some of its famous beaches include Diani Beach, Bamburi Beach and Nyali Beach.</p>

            <h2>10. Kenya is home to world record breakers</h2>
            <p>Kenya is famous for its production line of long-distance runners, most of whom come from the western part of the country, near Eldoret.

            Widely regarded as the greatest marathon runner of all time, Eliud Kipchoge is the 2016 and 2020 Olympic marathon champion and the world record holder with a time of 2:01:09 set at the 2022 Berlin Marathon. Keep an eye out for him as he competes at his third Olympics in Paris in 2024.</p>
